      <p>Our mission is for the SBC Music Family to be an example to all.  God has given us the power to defeat division, confusion, separation, and pride with LOVE.  1 Corinthians 13:13 says LOVE is greater than faith and hope.  Let our actions speak louder than our words.  Let it start in the mirror, then it will spread to those around us.  We can make a difference.
I ask this month that you pray for dedication: A devoting or setting aside for a particular purpose; self-sacrificing.</p><p>Aaron Richardson, Minister of Music</p>

      <p>Our commitment to missions and mission work can be seen in our support of the Local Homeless Shelters by partnering with Path of Life Ministry, churches and outreach opportunities right here in our own backyard. SBC supports two local homeless shelters, the Community and the Family Shelters. Many people have fallen on hard time, and need a little help through the Homeless Shelters.
